My coursework for MIT OCW 6.034 Artificial Intelligence Fall 2010 class.

All solutions are my own.

This coursework only includes the coding assignments. Among the 9 MIT coursework repositories on my GitHub, this is the only one that is incomplete. This was intentional, as the field has advanced significantly since 2010.

For clarity, only created or edited code files are included.

Taught by the late [Prof. Patrick Henry Winston](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?q=Prof.+Patrick+Henry+Winston) and Recitation Instructor Mark Seifter.
